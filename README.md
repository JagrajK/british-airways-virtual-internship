# british-airways-virtual-internship
These are my solutions to the British Airways Data Science virtual internship.
Task 1 was to perform web scraping to obtain 1000 customer reviews and analyse sentiment based on these.
Task 2 gave a dataset and asked us to train a predictive model on this, and also find out which features were most important to the model's predictive power.

At the end, I presented my findings in a single powerpoint slide for each task.
